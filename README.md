Components:

Arduino Uno Microcontroller,

matrix,

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor,

DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC),

HC05 Bluetooth Module,

9V Battery.


What it does?

We put all the components on a single matrix and wrote a code on Arduino IDE (importing the library "DS3231" is required).
The Kit of Arduino Microcontroller and its components is built on the top of the recycling bin. Twice a day, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the top of the plastic packagings and if this distance is under 80% of the recycling bin's height an alarm is sent to a phone's application through bluetooth.
